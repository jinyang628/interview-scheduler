# Interview Scheduler

This Chrome extension automatically schedules meetings on google calendar based on the information present in the the email content. It also helps you to draft a short appropriate reply to the sender.

~PLACEHOLDER~

## TODO

1. Only schedule meetings for the opened conversation
2. Check if that slot is already booked and propose a different time given the constraints laid out by the sender (need to make additional API calls to google calendar)
 

## Notes

1. Everytime I unpack an extension locally to test, I need to update the redirect uri in google cloud console
